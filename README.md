# ExpressionParser
Mathematical expressions implementation. Expression parser implementation (recursive decent method) 

# Mathematical expressions
This code is the implementation of mathematical expressions (expression package). The code is based on objective-oriented programming methods: the common code is moved to parent classes, classes implement interfaces, abstract classes are used too. So, mathematical addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, negation, constants and variables are implemented this way. Expressions can be evaluated with three variables: x, y and z. Encapsulation rules are also followed.
